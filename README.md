# Verification Page
A simple Page-Protection Verification page developed in [PHP](https://secure.php.net/); used to protect webpages you'd like only people who have access to a key to see.

## Requirements
* PHP â‰¥ 5.4

## Tutorial
1. Firstly, [download](https://github.com/henry7720/Verification-Page/archive/master.zip) all of the files in any way you please.
2. Next, generate a BCRYPT hash for your password with [hashgenerator.php](hashgenerator.php). If you are going to do this yourself, base64 encode the sha256 hash of your password string, and then BCRYPT the base64 encoded sha256 hash.
3. Next, open up [verification.php](verification.php#L3) and replace the `$hashedkey` variable's value with your hashed password. Use single quotes for the string, so that there are no variable parsing issues. 
If you are aware of any particular pages you'd like to password-protect, you may add them to the [`$whitelist` array](verification.php#L21) now. Make sure the page's path is a relative full path; with filename and extension, e.g `/foo/bar.php` or `/bar.php`.
4. Next, open up [php-snippets.txt](php-snippets.md) and follow the particular instructions for using the PHP snippets to protect pages.
5. Finally, create a new page with the PHP snippets, or use our [pre-made example](index.php) (as a template), and that page will be password-protected, making sure that the page has been added to the whitelist.

**Note**: if you are confused, make sure to read the inline comments for further explanation.
